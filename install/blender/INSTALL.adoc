=== Install

. First make sure PySide2 is present in, for example, `C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 2.83\2.83\python\lib\site-packages`
. Make a directory junction link to `./{app_name}` at `C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 2.82\2.82\scripts\addons`. Name that directory however you like.
. Our new Blender add-on requires that:
- a `__init__.py` is put under `./{app_name}`
- a `blender.py` is put under `src/gui/app/{app_name}`
