=== Quick Guides
**Set Dress Master** includes two sets of functionalities:

.  **PhysX Painter**, which utilizes Maya's native **MASH** plugin and its dynamics simulation in order to aid set dressing 
.  **Swap Master**, which allows for restoring scattered objects' transforms, and by doing so optionally reconstructing the instancing

.Compatibility
IMPORTANT: For Maya 2018 and above

''''
===== 1. PhysX Painter

This section of the UI allows for easily taking advantage of the **MASH** system and the **Bullet Solver** to quickly place the objects while having them look "physically correct".

.Load the paint surface(s), the meshes to scatter, and the landing surface(s), by pressing the respective `Load` button

*  After providing the elements above, press `Setup MASH Network`

.To start painting we'll need to access the `Add` brush in the Attribute Editor of the Paint (Placer) node

*  `Go to Time Zero` if need be. Dynamics simulation usually requires this to function properly
*  Press `Show Paint Node` if the Attribute Editor isn't focusing to the Paint (Placer) node as shown above
*  Press `Interactive Playback` and then the `Add` brush
*  You can now start painting -- onto the paint surface(s) specified
*  At any point during simulation you can press `Bake Current` to store a snapshot of the simulated meshes at that moment

NOTE: See more in Details section below


===== 2. Swap Master

This section of the UI allows for "swapping" scattered, combined, meshes, with desired geometry, preferably together with the ability to restoring their transforms, and/or reconstructing the instancing.

IMPORTANT: Currently the algorithm for restoring the transforms requires providing of a "North pole", a "South pole", and a "Yaw axis", that may not work well with all types of geometry. Future releases will include additional algorithms to compensate for this limitation.







NOTE: See more in Details section below

=== Details

===== 1. PhysX Painter

After painting and baking the frames you want from the simulation, usually you'll want to move to the next stage of reconstructing the instancing for the scattered meshes. 

*  To do this, first remove all things related to the MASH network by pressing `Delete MASH Setup`. 

CAUTION: For safety purposes, remember to save your scene first, as the **MASH** plugin has some bugs that might cause crash when performing this cleanup.

*  Press `Show All Baked` in order to select all the meshes cloned whenever you pressed `Bake Current`.

===== 2. Swap Master

=== Installation


=== Known Issues

*  Undo is not supported

=== Road Map

*  [PhysX Painter] Allow for face selection as input for both paint and landing surfaces
*  [PhysX Painter] Allow for scale variability during painting
